In January 2018 I published a fact-check story that proved the differences in resources in the primary healthcare service within Andalucía. This was a project carried out for the MA Data Journalism at Birmingham City University. 

The graphics above are some of the charts published in "Fact-check: Are there differences in the health service among provinces?", as a result of the analysis. 

The parameters considered in this work agree with those taken into account by the Spanish Health Ministry to assess the area. I analysed professionals, centres, and frequency among the eight provinces from Andalucía and among the health areas (smaller sanitary divisions). 

## Get the data

The data was downloaded from the <a href="https://www.msssi.gob.es/estadEstudios/estadisticas/sisInfSanSNS/home.htm">Spanish Health Ministry database</a>.
